# Introduction 

**Machine learning** refers to information processing algorithms that are designed by *learning from data*, not by physical models. 
Examples of *supervised* machine learning tasks include *classification*, *regression*, and examples of *unsupervised* tasks include *clustering* and *principle components analysis* (PCA).
Since this course will be taught in **Python**, we present a *Jupyter Notebook* demonstration of vector processing using the `numpy` library.
