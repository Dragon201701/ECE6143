# Model selection and regularization

A key issue in statistical modeling is to determine the suitable complexity
of the model to use.  More complex models can capture more of the relationship
between the predictors and target variable.  But, using more complex models risks
over-fitting.  We illustrate some simple model order selection techniques.
